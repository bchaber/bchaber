### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Bartosz Chaber (ten/tego)

Right now I have four main projects on my plate:
- ðŸ‘· *pole* which is a Finite Volume Method Poisson equation solver on structured grids,
- ðŸ‘· *fala* which is a Finite Element Method Maxwell equations solver on structured grids with Whitney (edge) elements,
- ðŸ‘· *iskra* which is a Particle-in-Cell simulator for electric discharges,
- *hv* which is a Finite Volume Method advection-diffusion-reaction solver for charged "fluids".
