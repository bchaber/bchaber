### Hi there 👋
**Bartosz Chaber** (ten/tego 😏)

> I have approximate knowledge of many things.
_Demon Cat / Adventure Time_

My background is in computer science but at one point in time I found that I am more interested in code *doing* something fun, rather than it *looking* pretty.
I enjoy writing code that others already wrote. This is my way of learning: by recreating things, improving them, breaking them to pieces and bringing back as a mosaic of my adventures (or mistakes if you prefer).

Right now I have four main projects on my plate 🍽️:
- 👷 *pole* which is a fast Finite Volume Method Poisson equation solver on structured grids,
- 👷 *fala* which is a circuit-integrated Finite Element Method Maxwell equations solver on structured grids with Whitney (edge) elements,
- 👷 *iskra* which is a Particle-in-Cell simulator for electric discharges,
- 👷 *hattivatti* which uses a Lattice Boltzmann method for solving a problem o streamer propagation.
