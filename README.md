### Hi there 👋
**Bartosz Chaber** (ten/tego)

My background is in computer science but at one point in time I found that I am more interested in code *doing* something fun, rather than it *looking* pretty.
I enjoy writing code that others already wrote. This is my way of learning: by recreating things, improving them, breaking them to pieces and bringing back as a mosaic of my adventures.

Right now I have four main projects on my plate:
- 👷 *pole* which is a Finite Volume Method Poisson equation solver on structured grids,
- 👷 *fala* which is a Finite Element Method Maxwell equations solver on structured grids with Whitney (edge) elements,
- 👷 *iskra* which is a Particle-in-Cell simulator for electric discharges,
- *hv* which is a Finite Volume Method advection-diffusion-reaction solver for charged "fluids".
